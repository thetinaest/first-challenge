# first-challenge: Horiseon Landing Page

You can view the Horiseon Landing page here: https://thetinaest.github.io/first-challenge

# Description of Challenge Completion

This is the landing page for Horiseon. HTML has been updated to include semantic elements to improve accessability. Css has been consolidated while still functioning as intended. All page links bring you to the correct section as well. Icons have alt attributes to let screen readers know they are simply icons. CSS and HTML has been commented to help keep the code more readable and succint. 

# Look of the Page
